# Portfolio
I am in the process of updating my portfolio to feature more advanced work, such as state-of-the-art deep learning models, REST APIs, and deploying end-to-end data pipelines on GCP. Below are personal projects I developed three years ago:

- [Market Trend Analysis of the Airbnb Market in London](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gabrielsanchez94/impact-of-covid-on-london-airbnb-market):
    - Performed time series analysis of occupation rates of Airbnb listings in London.
    - Assessed changes in prices and distribution of types of listings across all London boroughs.
- [Answering Business Questions using SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gabrielsanchez94/answering-business-questions-using-sql):
    - Analysed distribution of product sales and customer behaviour of an online music store.
    - Guided Project as part of Dataquest Science Path.
- [Churn Prediction of Credit Card Customers](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gabrielsanchez94/ml-churn-prediction):
    - Developed a Machine Learning Ensemble model to predict with 96.7% accuracy which customers of a bank will leave their credit card services.
